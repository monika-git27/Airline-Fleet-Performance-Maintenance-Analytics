#  Airline Fleet Performance & Maintenance Analytics

##  Project Overview
Airlines operate complex fleets where aircraft age, fuel efficiency, maintenance risk, and spare-parts planning directly impact cost, safety, and operational reliability.

This project delivers an end-to-end data analytics solution to analyze airline fleet performance and support data-driven maintenance, retirement, and planning decisions.

Using Python-based analysis and visualization, the project transforms raw fleet data into actionable insights through KPIs, forecasts, and an executive-style dashboard.

---

##  Business Objectives
The project aims to help airline stakeholders:

- Monitor fleet health and operational status
- Identify high-risk and aging aircraft
- Forecast spare parts demand
- Support aircraft retirement and replacement planning
- Improve fuel efficiency and maintenance cost control
- Reduce operational complexity through fleet standardization insights

---

##  Key Business Questions Addressed
- How is the fleet distributed across age groups (new, mid-life, old)?
- Which aircraft models contribute most to maintenance risk?
- What is the spare parts demand by aircraft age and engine type?
- Which aircraft are nearing retirement thresholds?
- How fuel-efficient are different aircraft models?
- What is the active vs retired vs under-maintenance fleet mix?
- How complex is the fleet in terms of model and engine diversity?
- Which aircraft require immediate vs near-term retirement?
- How does aircraft age impact fuel inefficiency and maintenance demand?

##  Project Workflow

### 1️. Data Cleaning & Preparation
- Cleaned and standardized fleet data  
- Handled missing values and inconsistencies  
- Derived key metrics such as:
  - Aircraft age  
  - Fleet status  
  - Fuel burn per seat  
  - Risk classification  



---

### 2️. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyzed aircraft age distribution  
- Evaluated fleet status mix  
- Identified early signals of:
  - Maintenance risk  
  - Fuel inefficiency  
  - Aging fleet segments  



---

### 3️. Analytical Use Cases
The following business applications were implemented:

- Aircraft Age Group Classification  
- Spare Parts Demand Forecast  
- Fleet Standardization (Complexity Index)  
- Aircraft Retirement Forecast  
- Engine Reliability Risk by Age  
- Spare Part Demand by Age Group  
- Engine Type & Spare Part Planning  
- Active vs Retired Fleet Transition  
- Fuel Inefficiency & Maintenance Demand  

 
---

### 4️. Data Visualization & Dashboard
Built an executive-level dashboard to summarize insights:

####  Key KPIs
- Total Aircraft  
- Active Aircraft  
- Average Fleet Age  
- Average Fuel Burn per Seat  
- High-Risk Aircraft Count  

####  Visual Insights
- Fleet count by aircraft model  
- Fuel efficiency ranking  
- Fleet status distribution  
- Aircraft age distribution  
- Spare parts demand categories  
- Retirement forecast by aircraft model  


 ## Power BI Dashboard
![Fleet Performance Dashboard](https://github.com/monika-git27/Fleet-Analytics-Maintenance-Planning/blob/main/Dashboard.png)

The Power BI dashboard provides:

- Fleet KPIs (total aircraft, active fleet, average age)

- Fuel efficiency rankings by aircraft model

- Age distribution and retirement readiness

- Maintenance and spare-parts demand categories

 Interactive filters allow users to analyze data by:

- Airline

- Aircraft model

- Status

- Age group
